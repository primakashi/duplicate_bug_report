Select Default Profile fails to locate Git Bash and include as dropdown option.
So I tried to create a new profile by pressing ctrl+shift+p then terminal said I already have a profile with Git Bash name.
Existing issues and an answer on stackoverflow seem to suggest that this problem occurs only when your Git Bash is not installed at the standard location (C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe) and the profile is named exactly "Git Bash".
I replaced the key-value pair above with the following key-value pair. Restarted VS Code, activated the command palette, selected Terminal: Select Default Profile and Git Bash appeared as a dropdown option. Selected Git Bash as the default terminal. Ran python file. Terminal pane opened Git Bash and code executed successfully.
