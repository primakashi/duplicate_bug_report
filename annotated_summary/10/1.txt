Sticky Scroll: Go to definition jumps to definitions but stay hidden behind sticky scroll layout
VS Code Version: 1.70.0
Steps to Reproduce:
Have a definition just hidden under the sticky scroll layout.
If you try to jump to that particular definition the cursor jumps to that position but the definition stays hidden under the layout.
It should be either disabled or maybe better have very limited context (a single line max?)
This is a general problem with revealing ranges in the editor. 
In the original screenshot, I also noticed that line 153 is repeated 3 times, I think that is already solved on main via 2ecea7f.
