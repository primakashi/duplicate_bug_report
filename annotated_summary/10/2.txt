Revealing in editor is not aware of sticky lines
VS Code Version: 1.70.0
Steps to Reproduce:
Have a definition just hidden under the sticky scroll layout.
If you try to jump to that particular definition the cursor jumps to that position but the definition stays hidden under the layout.
In the original screenshot, I also noticed that line 153 is repeated 3 times, I think that is already solved on main via 2ecea7f.
