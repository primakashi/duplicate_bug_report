Custom editors cannot be opened when a single-folder workspace has Been Extended To A Multi-Folder Workspace
I was running into an issue where closing a webview panel on extension deactivating. When I add a root to a multi-root workspace, the extension is deactivated (which is expected), but the panel isn't disposed although I specifically ask it to.
VSCode Version: 1.45.1
Steps to Reproduce:
Check out Cat Customs Sample
Install the extension
Copy the exampleFiles folder to exampleFiles2
Open a new VS Code Instance with exampleFiles as root folder
(Custom Editor works as intended)
Add exampleFiles2 to the workspace.
Open example.cscratch in exampleFile2 folder.
Converting a single folder to a workspace causes the extension host to restart, which causes any webviews to become detached from the extension that is running them
This also happens for webviews that are opened after the host has been restarted! 
@roblourens We trying to avoid abruptly closing webviews as they may contain unsaved work. There's not an elegant way to handle this for every webview, although we may be able to implement something for serializable webviews
