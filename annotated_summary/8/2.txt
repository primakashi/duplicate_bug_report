Converting a single folder to a workspace causes the extension host to restart, which causes any webviews to become detached from the extension that is running them
Repro steps in extension sample:
Use webview-sample extension sample.
Add code to close panel on deactivate:
export function deactivate() {
	CatCodingPanel.currentPanel?.dispose();
}
open a single-root workspace and start the extension sample (should have the webview appear).
Add another root to the workspace. The messages should stop (since the extension deactivated), but the panel still exists.
