Searching keyboard shortcuts with 'Record Keys' does not include chords using that keybinding
As a default, it might be better for 'Record Keys' to use the un-quoted search string, so chords would show up as well.
all coord'ed keybindings, like Cmd+K, Cmd+S etc are missing
For example, on macOS using the default VS Code keybindings, "cmd+k" is the first shortcut in many, many chords.
Notice that only shortcuts using the exact binding "cmd+k" show up, not all the bindings that start with that prefix.
If you remove the quotes (cmd+k), then all matches show up, including chords.
