Terminal doesn't work and there is no error message after upgrade.
Yesterday, there was an upgrade. I tried to restart my vscode to apply the upgrade. After the restart, the terminal stopped working.
I found this error log in the file remoteagent.log.
It seems that this folder is occupied by other users. And when I tried to delete this folder and reload vs-code, the terminal resumed.
So, how can I change the default path for zsh?
I'm getting the same error when connecting to a multi-user system with the ssh extension.
The terminal cannot be opened when multiple users use remote-ssh
When I used Remote-SSH today, I found that the terminal could not be opened. After checking the log, I found the following error output:
[2022-08-09 15:52:42.302] [remoteagent] [error] ["Error: EACCES: permission denied, copyfile '/home/{myuser}/.vscode-server/bin/da76f93349a72022ca4670c1b84860304616aaa2/out/vs/workbench/contrib/terminal/browser/media/shellIntegration-rc.zsh' -> '/tmp/vscode-zsh/.zshrc'"]
Since the terminal I use is zsh, vscode-server copies my .zshrc to /tmp/vscode-zsh/.zshrc, and the permission of this file belongs to me. As a result, the other users who use zsh as the terminal cannot open the terminal when using Remote-SSH for no permission to overwrite this file.
And I find that when the user uses bash, vscode-server does not copy .bashrc to /tmp/vscode-bash/.bashrc. Therefore, this bug does not exist when bash is used by all users
VS Code version: Code 1.70.0
After I rolled the software back to the previous version, the issue was solved.
Rolling back to 1.69.2 and disabling auto update of VSCode solves the problem currently...
Thanks for the report, you can workaround this by disabling shell integration automatic injection with "terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": false and then installing it manually in your .zshrc:
[[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]] && . "$(code --locate-shell-integration-path zsh)"
