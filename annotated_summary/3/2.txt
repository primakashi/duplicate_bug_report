Loses text when maximizing the integrated terminal
When I maximize the terminal, only visible text at the bottom of the original size terminal remains. All the text above (which I can see if I scroll up) disappears and they won't come back even if I minimize the terminal back.
Since conpty doesn't actually store any scrollback, it can't really push the scrollback rows back into the viewport
Steps to Reproduce:
Run commands on the terminal until the top of the terminal is full
Run another command. The top line will be deleted
Scroll up to see that the previous line is deleted
I provided working solution, which is switching to other operating system.
