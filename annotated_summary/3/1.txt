Steps to Reproduce:

Also works with any output (deletes 0 and 1 in this case)
When I maximize the terminal, only visible text at the bottom of the original size terminal remains. All the text above (which I can see if I scroll up) disappears and they won't come back even if I minimize the terminal back.
@zadjii-msft when resizing the viewport to include more columns, the normal behavior of a terminal is to push the scrollback back into the viewport, but WT/conpty seems to assume the scrollback remains. 
Since conpty doesn't actually store any scrollback, it can't really push the scrollback rows back into the viewport - those rows are already gone.
But this problem only occurs on Windows terminal, not on linux, and it doesn't occur on Windows VSCode which SSH remote connect to linux.
 It is NOT exclusive to Windows 11. 
See my video linked above.
I think it may be a region specific bug. 
Maybe it is related to encoding, because Microsoft uses weird encoding standards like "windows-1250", "windows-1252" and other non-standards for different countries.
I provided working solution, which is switching to other operating system. 
I strongly encourage people to try using UNIX-like systems, and I provided valid arguments for it. Unless there is something I don't know and Windows is now able to use common accepted standards.
