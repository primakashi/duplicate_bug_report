Bash shell script issue with "%" sign 
whenever I try to execute a command that has the % sign I get one of those two print errors:
I am running VS Code on a Windows host with a WSL (Ubuntu) remote session. 
I also do not get the error if I go and run the same command in a Windows Terminal bash shell from the same folder and same user inside my WSL environment.
I noticed the error started happening after the July 2022 update. 
VS Code version: Code 1.70.0 
Getting a similar issue on Mac with the latest July update.
Yes disabling shell integration will fix this until we have resolved it terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled
Did you notice https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_70#_shell-integration-enabled-by-default? Please try disabling shell integration to see if this change to the default has triggered your issue.
@Tyriar, there's actually a simpler way to fix this issue than escaping the % char ending up in the printf format string, by passing it as a separate parameter to printf.
