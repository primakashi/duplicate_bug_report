Black blocks in terminal at every underscore
VS Code Version: 1.70.2
Steps to Reproduce:
Open integrated terminal in vscode running on Void Linux
Type an underscore (_)
Edit:
Updated to 1.70.2 and issue still remains
I'm not the original reporter but turning the GPU acceleration off or setting it to canvas solves this problem.
 I'm guessing there is some conflict (Firefox only?) with this underscore shifting and the clear color mechanism of the webgl renderer.
Disabling acceleration in Firefox (i.e. setting layers.acceleration.disabled to true) doesn't help.
Turning terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration off or setting it to canvas fixes the issue.
It is font related. 
It's called "DejaVu Sans Mono" version 2.37
When using the desktop app in Ubuntu 22.04, the font Droid Sans Mono presents the same behavior. Using other fonts the underscore is rendered correctly.
