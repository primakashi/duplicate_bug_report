Git amend produces 500 error
GitHub Commit error after June VS Code update
Steps to Reproduce:
Create a commit
Add some changes
Commit amend the commit (... > Commit > Commit All (Amend) )
Running git commit --amend from the command line works
Yes, unchecking the Git: Use Editor As Commit Input setting fixes the issue
@DevelPaga, glad to hear that disabling git.useEditorAsCommitInput resolved this issue.
After reading the documentation I now understand the behavior :)
https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_author-commit-message-using-an-editor
so just untick this if you want the old experience
Thanks a million, this recent change they made was driving me crazy for the past 2 days. I use custom hot keys to commit and push my code, so I expect the text box to appear and ask for a message.
Fix:
Set useEditorAsCommitInput to false.
GitTest is a repo initialized FROM VSCode => Works.
GitTest2 is a repo initialized from a dos box. => Fails.
The VSCode created one has a user defined in the config while the the Git created one doesn't have a user defined.
and indeed setting the user in the config fixes the issue.
In previous versions it gives a prompt to insert the message
This issue has been fixed both in the latest Stable and Insiders releases.
