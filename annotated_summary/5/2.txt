useEditorAsCommitInput setting generates code 500 error
Steps to Reproduce:
Make changes to a file, stage the file
Make a commit with an empty message
Get a Git: Bad status code: 500 message box.
Previously I would get quick textbox allowing me to enter a one line message
Fix: Set useEditorAsCommitInput to false.
In the new update, when i use Source Control and try to commit an blank commit, It gives me an error that does not explain the error.
This issue has been fixed both in the latest Stable and Insiders releases.
glad to hear that disabling git.useEditorAsCommitInput resolved this issue.
