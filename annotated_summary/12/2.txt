I would love the ability to be able to easily toggle between the 3 way merge editor and the old merge editor.
Steps to Reproduce
When you enable 3-way merge editor(i.e. set "git.mergeEditor": true), and open conflicted file from Explorer, merge conflict isn't highlighted and it looks like plain text.
Merge conflict should be highlighted like the legacy merge conflict view.
If you don't like this system, you can disable it, which enables back the old function by disabling "Git: Merge Editor" in your preferences as @carloscbl said.
Unfortunately you need to reload/restart VS Code after toggling that setting.
