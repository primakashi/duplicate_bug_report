VS Code Deleted After Windows 25201.1000 Update
After restarting, the VS Code shortcut in my toolbar was replaced by the generic unknown windows application icon. 
Sounds like you told it to install the patch "Later". 
So after the reboot it messed up patching.
After reinstalling VS Code to same directory all my extensions are working and code I was working on last loaded right where I left off thankfully.
I've now downloaded and reinstalled VS Code and everything seems to be fine, but just thought you might like to know.
