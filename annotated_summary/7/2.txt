View locations reset 
Found an easy repro:
Create an empty profile P1 and move Timeline and Outline views to secondary sidebar as separate view containers
Create an empty profile P2
Switch from P2 to P1
Timeline and Outline views are not moved to secondary sidebar and remain in explorer
Refreshing the window fixes it.
Reloading does not fix my issue.
