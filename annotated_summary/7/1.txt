Views location is not getting updated when switching profiles 
I think this happened because I was testing profiles. My view locations have been reset.
Found an easy repro:
Have 2 windows open (not sure if this step is needed)
Disable profiles in settings (not sure if this step is needed)
Restart.
Enable profiles in settings
Restart
In one of the windows run "Settings Profiles: Create an Empty Settings Profile" and create a new empty profile
See that your new profile gets used in just that window 
In that same window run "Settings Profiles: Switch" and choose your default profile
See that your default profile is applied, but view locations are reset 
Create an empty profile P1 and move Timeline and Outline views to secondary sidebar as separate view containers
Create an empty profile P2
Switch from P2 to P1
Timeline and Outline views are not moved to secondary sidebar and remain in explorer
Refreshing the window fixes it.
Reloading does not fix my issue.
interesting, looks like this is specific to generated view containers, as moving an entire container from activity bar to secondary side bar is reflected correctly
