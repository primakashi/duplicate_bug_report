New rebase conflicts resolution completely broken. Diff worse than before.
I rebase a branch with a single word different, I get everything as a conflict and can't see where is the difference is.
The diff engine is seriously damaged...
3-way merge
only user_rst vs usr_rst
2-way merge
I should see only the line with the user_rst shown as a conflict, not the tens of lines I currently have.
VSCode should also try to be coherent on naming, 3-way doesn't exist even though it's named like that 3-way merge in the release note and everywhere else.
Even disabling the Merge Editor still opens a window with the conflicts...
Yep completely broken for me too!
@alexisfrjp I just reverted to 1.69.0 and all is working fine again!
Unfortunately you need to reload/restart VS Code after toggling that setting.
Can you share details of your merge conflict?
/duplicate #156608
