Underscores (_) in integrated terminal are surrounded by black box
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes
VS Code Version: 1.70.2
OS Version: Void Linux x86_64 running spectrwm
Steps to Reproduce:
Open integrated terminal in vscode running on Void Linux
Type an underscore (_)
Edit:
Updated to 1.70.2 and issue still remains
Proof:
does changing terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration help?
I'm not the original reporter but turning the GPU acceleration off or setting it to canvas solves this problem.
Thanks for the report, reopening #158497 and tracking there.

Disabling terminal gpu acceleration fixes this issue. Thanks
