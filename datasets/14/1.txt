Searching keyboard shortcuts with 'Record Keys' does not include chords using that keybinding
Type: Feature Request
If you use 'Record Keys' in the keyboard shortcuts settings to search for a keybinding (say, because you want to see if it's available, or why it's not triggering as you'd expect), you only see exact matches for that binding, not any chords that might use it as a prefix. This can be misleading if you aren't aware of this behavior.
As a default, it might be better for 'Record Keys' to use the un-quoted search string, so chords would show up as well.
I installed an extension which added keybindings using cmd+l as the first key in a chord. When the default behavior of plain cmd+l stopped working, I searched keyboard shortcuts (using Record Keys) for "cmd+l" to see if something had overridden it. Since the extension's keybinding didn't show up in that search (since it was cmd+l cmd+o), I believed something more complex was going on, and went through a whole extension bisect to realize that it was indeed just a simple keybinding issue.
Example:
Using 'Record Keys', search for a keybinding that you know is the prefix for a chord. For example, on macOS using the default VS Code keybindings, "cmd+k" is the first shortcut in many, many chords.
Notice that only shortcuts using the exact binding "cmd+k" show up, not all the bindings that start with that prefix.
If you remove the quotes (cmd+k), then all matches show up, including chords.
