the git output
Please supply the message using either -m or -F option.
In previous versions it gives a prompt to insert the message
I am having the exact same issue. I could use blank commit messages last week but today I am getting the same exact error. If I have a commit message I am able to do the commit.

Please try the settings change suggested at #154449 (comment)

If this works you can either keep that setting long-term or else revert it after the upcoming 1.69.1 recovery release ships.
Another option would be to use the latest Insiders release which contains a fix for this issue.
The fix will also be included in the Stable recovery release that is planned for later this week.
This issue has been fixed both in the latest Stable and Insiders releases.
