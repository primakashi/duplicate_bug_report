Views location is not getting updated when switching profiles
Enable Settings Profiles
Create an empty profile P1 and move Timeline and Outline views to secondary sidebar as separate view containers
Create an empty profile P2
Switch from P2 to P1
üêõ Timeline and Outline views are not moved to secondary sidebar and remain in explorer
Refreshing the window fixes it.
Similar to #153655
interesting, looks like this is specific to generated view containers, as moving an entire container from activity bar to secondary side bar is reflected correctly
yes. root cause is the order of storage events. This happens during storage change with views cache storage change comes first followed by view containers cache storage change.
