View locations reset 
I think this happened because I was testing profiles. My view locations have been reset. I have Gitlens installed, and I had a few of the Gitlens views in their own view container. Now, they're back in their default view container (scm).
May I know if you are able to reproduce? If so can you please provide steps?
Found an easy repro:
Have 2 windows open (not sure if this step is needed)
Disable profiles in settings (not sure if this step is needed)
Restart.
Enable profiles in settings
Restart
In one of the windows run "Settings Profiles: Create an Empty Settings Profile" and create a new empty profile
See that your new profile gets used in just that window âœ…
In that same window run "Settings Profiles: Switch" and choose your default profile
See that your default profile is applied, but view locations are reset ðŸª²

Thanks for the steps. I think you might be hitting this - #154090
@sandy081 I took a look at the steps in the duplicate issue, and it says that reloading fixes the issue. Reloading does not fix my issue.
I am planning to look at #154090 next milestone and during then I will cover this too.
