Open file and then search opens the wrong find widget
Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes/No
VS Code Version:
OS Version:
Click on a file in File Explorer
Ctrl/Cmd+F
1.69.2 Opens the find widget in editor
1.70 Opens the find widget in File Explorer
It breaks workflows of opening files and searching for content.
I had previously reported this as #155924
We had a discussion today in the standup and came to the conclusion that in the end this is the only way how to discover the new find widget in the list.
Some ideas:
gather more feedback next month from users to see how bad it is
document in the release notes how to unbind this keybinding [1]
work on finding other ways how to make the find widget discoverable
[1] for keybindings configure:
{"key": "cmd+f",
    "command": "-list.find",
    "when": "listFocus && treeSupportsFind"}
If you use the above to disable that keybinding, you can also assign a different keybinding for list.find, that seems like a good way to have both features. You can also double+click in the explorer to focus the editor you opened, but this also pins that editor.
I'd vote against adding a search icon menu button on every tree to show the widget or anything like that.
From standup in Redmond today, we agreed that we should not change this as a candidate for 1.70, but should monitor feedback from users and see if we want to change anything there.
