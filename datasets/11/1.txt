bash: printf: `C': invalid format character error in bash terminal
Type: Bug
I am running VS Code on a Windows host with a WSL (Ubuntu) remote session. I am seeing the error "bash: printf: `C': invalid format character" in bash terminals inside the IDE. I don't get the error every time, but I'm seeing it frequently for various commands and tools. When I get the error, the command also seems to hang until I kill it. I also do not get the error if I go and run the same command in a Windows Terminal bash shell from the same folder and same user inside my WSL environment.
I noticed the error started happening after the July 2022 update. There was a new feature automatically enabled that does some kind of shell integration and decorates command lines with a default/success/error icon. I am suspicious if this is causing the new error. I have not seen the error when having the decorators disabled.
I can include more information, logs, settings, environment, etc. if needed but I am not sure what else is relevant. Below is the information from the generated issue report.
VS Code version: Code 1.70.0 (da76f93, 2022-08-04T04:38:16.462Z)
OS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19044
Modes:
Remote OS version: Linux x64 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
Remote OS version: Linux x64 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
Running with "set -x" shows the command line isn't being escaped during a call to printf. Simple test case:
$ date +%m
bash: printf: `m': invalid format character
$ unset PROMPT_COMMAND
$ date +%m
08
Getting a similar issue on Mac with the latest July update. Glad to know it's not just me.
Yes disabling shell integration will fix this until we have resolved it terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled
