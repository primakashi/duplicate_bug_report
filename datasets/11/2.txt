Bash shell script issue with "%" sign 
I'm using VSCODE for my ssh sessions. Since the July 2022 update, whenever I try to execute a command that has the % sign I get one of those two print errors:
bash: printf: '\': invalid format character
bash: printf: 'Z': invalid format character
I tried a different ssh client and the issue doesn't appear, so it's something with this update. Is anyone aware of a solution?
Did you notice https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_70#_shell-integration-enabled-by-default? Please try disabling shell integration to see if this change to the default has triggered your issue.
Yes, that did the trick. Thanks!
It's to do with 633 E:
builtin printf '\033]633;E;echo '\''%'\''\007'
bash: printf: `\': invalid format character
Same problem in zsh:
@Tyriar, there's actually a simpler way to fix this issue than escaping the % char ending up in the printf format string, by passing it as a separate parameter to printf.
I have left a comment in the linked pr as well: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/157352/files#r939627065
builtin printf "\033]633;E;%s\007" "$__vsc_current_command"
@ryenus that's much nicer if it works üëç
It should, as the same approach is already used in __vsc_update_cwd(), and __vsc_command_complete().
BTW, thank you for being open and kind üëç
